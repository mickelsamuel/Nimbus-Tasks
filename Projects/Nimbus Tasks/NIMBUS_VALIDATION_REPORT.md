## Known Issues & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Development Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **LocalStack Container:** Volume mount issues on macOS
   - **Impact:** Low (dev-only, production S3 ready)
   - **Workaround:** Use AWS S3 for testing

2. **Prisma Migration:** Permission errors in development
   - **Impact:** Low (manual schema creation works)
   - **Workaround:** Direct SQL execution

3. **E2E Test Selectors:** Some UI specificity issues
   - **Impact:** Low (functionality works, tests need refinement)
   - **Recommendation:** Add data-testid attributes

### 🚀 Production Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure all production secrets are configured
2. **Database Migration:** Run Prisma migrations in production pipeline
3. **Monitoring:** Configure alert thresholds for key metrics
4. **Backup Strategy:** Implement automated database backups
5. **Rate Limiting:** Configure rate limits for API endpoints
