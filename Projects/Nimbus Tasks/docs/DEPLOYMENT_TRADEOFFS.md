## üéØ Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code made deployments repeatable
2. **ECS Fargate**: Excellent balance of simplicity and power
3. **GitHub Actions**: Smooth CI/CD integration
4. **Managed Services**: Reduced operational overhead significantly

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Start with Aurora Serverless**: Despite cold starts, might be worth it for cost
2. **More Monitoring**: Should have set up more detailed monitoring from day one
3. **Staging Environment**: Would have helped catch issues earlier
4. **Load Testing**: Earlier load testing would have informed scaling decisions

### Key Takeaways

1. **Managed services are worth the cost** for early-stage applications
2. **Observability is not optional** in production
3. **Security should be built in** from the beginning
4. **Cost optimization is an ongoing process**, not a one-time activity
5. **Documentation is critical** for operational success
